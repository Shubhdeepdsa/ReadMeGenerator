# GitHub Repository Documentation Generator

An AI-driven Next.js application for automatically generating documentation for GitHub repositories.

## Description

Good documentation is vital to the success of any project, but writing it can be a tedious task. Our GitHub Repository Documentation Generator aims to make this process easier and more efficient.

This application uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the source code and comments of a given GitHub repository. By doing so, it can automatically generate an in-depth, comprehensive documentation that provides an overview of the repository structure, files, functions, classes, and more.

The project uses Next.js, a powerful JavaScript framework built on React, for the front-end. The AI model is implemented using a Python backend with an appropriate machine learning library. The front-end and back-end communicate through a RESTful API.
