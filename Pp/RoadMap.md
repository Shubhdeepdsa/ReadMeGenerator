    - **Task 1.2.1:** Install necessary software - Node.js, a high-quality code editor, and any specific packages relevant to the project.
    - **Task 1.2.2:** Initialize a new Next.js project and familiarize yourself with its structure.
    
### Phase 2: UI/UX Design and Planning 
**Week 1, Day 3 - 5**
  - **Task 2.1:** Define the key components of your application. Create wireframes and mockups detailing the layout, functionality, and user flow.
  - **Task 2.2:** Plan the routes for your Next.js application. Decide on how your app will handle different routes and what components should render on each page.

### Phase 3: Github API Exploration & Integration 
**Week 1, Day 6 - Week 2, Day 2**
  - **Task 3.1:** Explore the Github API:
    - **Task 3.1.1:** Study the API documentation - understand how to authenticate, make requests, and handle responses.
    - **Task 3.1.2:** Identify the necessary endpoints to retrieve a repository's content.
  - **Task 3.2:** Design and implement the functions to get a GitHub repository content:
    - **Task 3.2.1:** Write the function to fetch data from Github API.
    - **Task 3.2.2:** Test the function with several repositories to ensure it's working correctly.
  
### Phase 4: Code Analysis 
**Week 2, Day 3 - 8**
  - **Task 4.1:** Decide on the syntax analysis approach.
  - **Task 4.2:** Design and implement the functions to extract the necessary information from the source code.
  
### Phase 5: AI-based Content Generation 
**Week 2, Day 8 - Week 4, Day 1**
  - **Task 5.1:** Explore AI libraries that can be used for content generation.
  - **Task 5.2:** Prepare the data for AI model:
    - **Task 5.2.1:** Tokenize the extracted information.
    - **Task 5.2.2:** Feed the tokenized data into the AI model and generate the content.

### Phase 6: Display the Generated Content 
**Week 4, Day 2 - 4**
  - **Task 6.1:** Design and implement a function to display the generated content in a user-friendly and engaging format.

### Phase 7: Testing  
**Week 4, Day 5 - 7**
  - **Task 7.1:** Write and perform unit tests for each module.
  - **Task 7.2:** Write and perform integration tests to ensure all modules work harmoniously together.

### Phase 8: Deployment 
**Week 4, Day 7**
  - **Task 8.1:** Choose and set up a deployment platform such as Vercel or Netlify.
  - **Task 8.2:** Deploy the site and make sure it's running as expected.

Remember, this is a rough estimate. It's dependent upon your experience, the size and complexity of your project, and unforeseen complications. Learning how to adapt and being flexible is an essential skill in software development. Prepare for adjustments as required during your process.
